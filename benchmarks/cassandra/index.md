Aerospike is working on new benchmarks with different use cases. The current benchmark can be found at:

[Comparing NoSQL Databases - Aerospike and Cassandra: Benchmarking for Real](/blog/comparing-nosql-databases-aerospike-and-cassandra)

Most benchmarks put out by database companies focus on maximum throughput, often for periods of time less than one hour. While this is useful marketing for the database companies, real production deployments often require very different configurations. 

In order to create benchmarks that more closely resemble the real world, we compare Aerospike with Cassandra for simple, but large-scale use cases with the most accepted NoSQL benchmark tool: the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark.
