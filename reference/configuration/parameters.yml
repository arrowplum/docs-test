        The minimum number of nodes required for a cluster to form. Necessary when configured with [`index-type flash`](/docs/reference/configuration/#index-type)

      extra-note    : |
        When running in [`strong-consistency`](/docs/reference/configuration/#strong-consistency) mode, if the desired `min-cluster-size` represents less than half the total number of 
        nodes in the cluster, the `min-cluster-size` should not be configured. Indeed, minority sub-clusters make all partitions unavailable except the ones for which all the replicas 
        are in the sub-cluster, so there is no new partition ownership, and no increase in index device space or RAM required. This serves the same purpose as configuring `min-cluster-size`, 
        but is better since there will be some availability in the sub-cluster. (If `min-cluster-size` is configured in such cases, eventually the nodes in the sub-cluster that can't form will make everything unavailable.)
        <br><br>Also, for [Available mode](/docs/architecture/consistency.html#available-mode) (AP) namespaces the replication factor drops to 1 when a 1-node sub-cluster forms. So e.g. with replication factor 2, if `min-cluster-size` is not configured, a 1-node 
        sub-cluster is no worse than a 2-node sub-cluster in terms of the resources required. Of course, large cluster, it is necessary to configure `min-cluster-size` significantly higher than 2 or 3.

                 Set min-cluster-size dynamically to 6

        Allows specifying the `node-id` of the node as a 1 to 16 character (in hexadecimal), in order to make it friendlier or to
        influence the partition distribution which is based off the cluster's node ids. By
        default, Aerospike derives the `node-id` from the configured fabric port and one of the server's network interface
        mac address (or, if configured, the mac address of the [`node-id-interface`](/docs/reference/configuration#node-id-interface)).
      extra-note    : |
        Node IDs can be changed one node at a time in a rolling fashion across a cluster.
      tip           : |

        configuration that is network attached (for example an EBS volume on AWS) which would be re-attached against a different instance
        which by default would have a different node id than the original one and hence causing more migrations.

        It is also useful for having human readable names to refer to different nodes in a cluster as well as configuring [`strong-consistency`](/docs/reference/configuration/?show-removed=1#strong-consistency)

        consistency impact.

        As of version 3.16.0.1, a cluster will not accept 2 nodes with the same `node-id`. Having 2 nodes with the same `node-id` in a 
        cluster would lead to erroneous and unexpected behavior. In particular,
        cluster size and data location would be incorrect and would result in poor performing and unusual data responses.

        How long to wait for success, in milliseconds before timing out a
        transaction from one server node to another (typically a write prole or a
        duplicate resolution). This would be overwritten by the client transaction timeout
        (if set).  Transactions taking longer than this time (or the time specified in the client policy) will return a
        timeout and tick the [`client_tsvc_timeout`](/docs/reference/metrics/#client_tsvc_timeout) metric.
      extra-note    : |
        The `transaction-max-ms` (or, if specified, the client set timeout) get checked in 3 different places:<br>
        - when a transaction is picked up from the transaction queue<br>
        - every 130ms when waiting in the rw-hash (see [`rw_in_progress`](/docs/reference/metrics/#rw_in_progress))<br>
        - every 75ms when waiting in the proxy-hash (see [`proxy_in_progress`](/docs/reference/metrics/#proxy_in_progress))<br><br>
        By default, a transaction will therefore not be retransmitted between server nodes (typically for write proles or duplicate resolution)
        if the client does not specify a transaction timeout (this is independent of the client retry policy).
        If a transaction timeout is specified by the client, or if the `transaction-max-ms` is increased, a transaction
        would be retried as many times as possible within this time frame. For example, if a client specifies a transaction timeout
        of 8 seconds, assuming there are network issues preventing a write to be processed on its prole side, the fabric
        transaction would be retried up to 3 times, with an interval starting at 1 second (default [`transaction-retry-ms`](/docs/reference/configuration#transaction-retry-ms))
        and doubled for every subsequent retry.

        Disables write duplicate resolution. Write duplicate resolution is
        needed after recovering from node maintenance/failure or a partition. We chase different versions
        of a record prior to applying the update. This only applies during migrations when multiple versions
        of a given partition may exist.

        Setting to true will disable write duplicate resolution which can
        improve write performance during migrations but may also result in lost
        updates. This setting has been removed as the performance impact of a write duplicate resolution
        in the recent releases has been drastically reduced. For special cases where performance is more
        important than potentially inaccurately updating records, this configuration has been reintroduced
        at the namespace level in version 3.15.1.3, under the name [`disable-write-dup-res`](/docs/reference/configuration/#disable-write-dup-res).

        This configuration controls the different options for CPU pinning. In order to use this configuration, both [`service-threads`](/docs/reference/configuration/#service-threads)
        and [`transaction-queues`](/docs/reference/configuration/#transaction-queues) should not be configured in the configuration file (and
        will default to the number of cores on the instance). Possible values are:
        - `none` - relying on kernel's irqbalance.
        - `cpu` - CPU pinning - ASD controls the interrupt affinity of all NIC queue interrupts.
        - `numa` - CPU and NUMA Pinning - restrict memory and cpu usage of ASD to a single NUMA node.
      detail        : |
        The CPU pinning requires Linux Kernel 3.19 and above. This is the default for Ubuntu 15.04 and above, but not Debian8 (3.16) nor CentOS7 (3.10.0).
        If necessary the Linux Kernel can be upgraded.
        When moving away from any auto-pinning, a reboot is necessary to restore the system defaults for interrupts. When
        setting `auto-pin` to cpu, `transaction-queues` and `service-threads` cannot be set in the config and will be
        forced to the number of CPU (which is the default in versions 3.12 and above).
        Contact Aerospike Support for recommendations and benchmarks details prior to using these configurations.
      extra-note    : |
        The network interface hardware should support MSI. MSI sends interrupts from a peripheral device (e.g., a NIC) 
        to the CPU via the PCI bus. Older hardware had dedicated lines for that, so any data exchange between the CPU 
        and the device went via the PCI bus and interrupts were handled via a separate path, out of band. But in recent 
        days everything goes through the PCI bus. Network interfaces not supporting MSI would assert with the following:
        ```
        FAILED ASSERTION (hardware): (hardware.c:1087) interface eth0 does not support MSIs
        ```
        It is also necessary for the ratio of NIC queues to CPU cores be greater than 1/4. The following message would 
        otherwise be logged on the console and the server would not start:
        ```
        WARNING (hardware): (hardware.c:1605) eth0 has very few NIC queues; only 8 out of 32 CPUs handle(s) NIC interrupts

          Context specifies the context and level of logging to be logged. You can use a combination of contexts and
          logging levels. This configuration can be used either with `file` or `console` type of logging.
          Different contexts and their logging levels can be obtained from the command.
          ```asciidoc
          asinfo -v log/0
          ```

          sample output:
          ```asciidoc
          misc:INFO;alloc:INFO;arenax:INFO;hardware:INFO;jem:INFO;msg:INFO;...
          ```

          supports the following logging levels:
          * context any info
          * context any debug
          * context any warning
          * context any critical
          * context any detail

          An access address is an IP address that is announced to clients and used by clients for connecting to the cluster.
          Because of NAT, a cluster node's access addresses may be different from its bind addresses (`address` configuration
          directive under the service stanza). The default value 'any' publishes all available interface IP addresses.
          Multiple access addresses can be specified. IPv4, IPv6 and DNS names can be used to specify access addresses.
          DNS names are expanded to all IP addresses they resolve to, IPv4 (A DNS resource records) as well as IPv6
          (AAAA DNS resource records). A different set of access addresses can also be specified through
          [`alternate-access-address`](/docs/reference/configuration#alternate-access-address) for example for XDR clients

            If not specified will default to `any` (mutual authentication without subject validation).
          * `false`: Use this for only client authenticating the server.
          * `any`: Use this is for a two way (mutual) authentication, both client and server need to be authenticated.
            Also check configs tls-cafile and tls-capath when set to this mode.
          * user-defined: Use this for two way (mutual) authentication along with subject validation. This would be the
          TLS name a cluster node would expect clients to present on incoming connections.<br><br>
          Note: false and any are incompatible with each other and incompatible with a subject name, so if false or any is used,

          There are three modes you can have TLS configured, authenticate-server, authenticate-both and encrypt-only.
          If not specified will default to authenticate-server.
          * `authenticate-both`: Use this is for a two way authentication, both client and server need to be authenticated.
            Also check configs tls-cafile and tls-capath when set to this mode.
          * `authenticate-server`: Use this for only client authenticating the server.
          * `encrypt-only`: This only encrypts the data on the transport layer, there will be no authentication on either the server or the client. "encrypt-only" is not supported for XDR traffic.

          For versions 3.15 and above, this parameter specifies which TLS parameters to use for the
          given context TLS connections. The TLS parameters are configured under the matching [`tls`](/docs/reference/configuration#tls)
          sub-stanza. This also implicitly specifies the TLS name the node will present on incoming client
          connections. Refer to [TLS Name Clarification](/docs/guide/security/tls.html#tls-name-clarification) for further details.
        detail       : |
          For versions 3.11 to 3.14, this directly sets the tls-name to be used as the other TLS related parameters
          are directly set within the same sub-stanza for those older versions. This can either be set to:<br>
          * `<cluster-name>` (literally) which will then pick the cluster-name defined in the
          Aerospike config file. <br>
          * `<hostname>`  (literally) which will then pick up the hostname from the system.<br>
          * User specific where any string can be picked, for example, `my-tls-name`.<br><br>
          This should match the certificate as well as what the client will be sending.

          If true, this namespace will make an effort to distribute partitions evenly to all nodes. To achieve
          uniform-balance, Aerospike must give up some migration performance for this namespace. Time required to
          complete migrations is only impacted when a node is either permanently added or removed; i.e., the time to
          complete migrations when a restarted node rejoins the cluster is not impacted.<br>
          **Has to be followed by a [`recluster`](/docs/reference/info/#recluster) command to be effective.**
          <br>
          For [`strong-consistency`](/docs/reference/configuration/#strong-consistency) enabled namespaces, 
          uniform-balance is computed for all nodes in the roster - if a
          node is offline, the balance will be less uniform (but likely better than without uniform-balance enabled). If
          the node is permanently down, or down for an extended duration, the administrator may choose to remove the
          offline node from the roster and issue a [`recluster`](/docs/reference/info/#recluster) command to readjust 
          the partition distribution back to a uniform-balance.
        extra-note    : |
          If any node in the cluster does not have the `prefer-uniform-balance` set to `true`, the cluser will revert 
          to not using the uniform balance scheme.

          allocated will be 2 x 256 x 128KiB.
          For example, for 2 devices, setting the value to 2048 will use
          2 x 2048 x 128KiB (512MiB). Also, note that wblocks that are in post-write-queue are not eligible
          to be defragmented. Therefore the post-write-queue should be kept small compared to the overall
          device size as the size allocated to the post-write-queue will not be defragmented.

          A namespace with a higher `migrate-order` may still make some progress before namespaces with lower

          Migration happen in units of partition. <br>
          A partition is ready to migrate out (emigrate) if:<br>

          So on a node, even if a namespace has a lower `migrate-order`, if it is master for a partition, it will have to wait for replicas to send
          it their copies of this partition before it can emigrate the merged partition back to the replicas. To maintain strict `migrate-order`
          the node will have to just wait and do nothing. However to speed up the entire migration process, we choose to allow this node
          to emigrate higher `migrate-order` namespace partitions if they are ready.

          For workloads potentially requiring more (values higher than 32K), Enterprise Edition licensees
          should contact Aerospike support for guidance. Even if the memory overhead seems acceptable, configuring too many sprigs may not 
          only provide no benefits, but could actually adversely affect a cluster: <br>
          - A sub-cluster would have to accommodate for all the sprigs that were in the larger cluster 
          (except if [min-cluster-size](/docs/reference/configuration/index.html?show-removed=1#min-cluster-size) 
          has been configured to prevent the formation of such sub-cluster).<br> 
          - The memory required would also have to be contiguous (fragmented memory may prevent the allocation of 
          memory).<br>
          - Having too many sprigs on a node could delay shut down and cause an unnecessary cold restart upon the subsequent 
          restart.<br><br>
          **Changing this configuration parameter will force a cold start.**
          Providing more trees (sprigs) reduces the number of levels and speeds up the search.
          It also causes the reduce lock blockage to be broken up (the reduce lock is unlocked between each sprig, and a sprig
          takes much less time to traverse than a single partition tree).

          even want to go all the way to the maximum of 4096 (336M overhead for Enterprise Edition), to anticipate future growth (as changing

          This parameter does not impact the cold restart conflict resolution policy. For version 3.8.3 and above,
          cold restart conflict resolution always uses the `last-update-time`.
          For records created prior to 3.8.3, the cold start resolution will fall back to `generation`.
          Also, in case of equal `last-update-time`, the tie is broken by generation.
        detail        : |
          Generation value could wrap back to 0 on a record with a high update rate (Max of 65K generation number per Records).
          On cold-start a previous copy with higher generation number may be re-indexed and lead to stale data being available.
          last-update-time is the recommended value.

          proles will be used only when a node at the source cluster goes down. It is usually fine to have the digestlog on rotational drives as

          - If a local write updates more than 80% of the data in a record (for versions prior to 3.10.0.3, the logic is for more than 80% of the bins in a record),
          then the complete record is shipped to save a complete record read at the destination.
          - The underlying implementation makes use of a bloom filter which may lead to false positives. In most common cases, though, the probability of
          a false positive (shipping an extra bin that was not modified) is extremely low (< 0.001 %). Do not hesitate to contact Aerospike for further
          details regarding specific use cases.
          - If a digest log entry is relogged (due to transient issue when shipping to the destination) the entire record will be shipped

          0 means unlimited. In case of shipping to multiple destination clusters, this control the maximum throughput per destination,
          so the total throughput will be at most the maximum throughput times the number of destination. For example,

          Use this to limit the throughput to the destination clusters. This is useful to prevent flooding the network in case of unexpected

          XDR actually turns this into a maximum number of objects that can be inflight, based on the link latency for a given DC. For example,
          if a link between 2 DCs has a round trip latency of 10ms, putting 1 record at a time on the link (1 record in flight) would allow for
          100 records to be written every second (throughput of 100). In default configuration (no `xdr-max-ship-throughput` set) the derived

          'batch' mode is more efficient for most setups, but it might not keep up under high
          read/write load of ASD. 'single' mode is more reliable during migrations.
          <br>You might not see immediate effect of this configuration when modifying. This is because we wait for the ongoing batch of records
          to finish processing before switching the mode. In a cluster with no XDR lag, this should be done in < 10 seconds.

          Controls how much time (in milliseconds) to wait in between shipping of hot-keys. Replaces xdr-hotkey-maxskip.
        extra-note    : |
          To avoid shipping hotkeys in close succession, XDR maintains a cache for each 
          [`xdr-read-thread`](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/reference/configuration/index.html#xdr-read-threads) thread.  
          When a `digest` is read from the`digest log` it is entered into the cache and shipped.  The `digest` remains in 
          the cache for `xdr-hotkey-time-ms`  If, during that time, the same `digest` is read from the `digest log`, the 
          entry in the cache is marked as 'dirty' and the `digest` is not shipped.  At the end of `xdr-hotkey-time-ms`, 
          any `digests` marked as dirty are shipped and the dirty flag is removed, the timer is also restarted.  If a 
          record does not have the dirty flag, at the end of `xdr-hotkey-time-ms` it is removed from the cache.  The net 
          effect is that a frequently updated record will not be shipped more than once every `xdr-hotkey-time-ms` interval.  
          <br>Decreasing `xdr-hotkey-time-ms` will increase the frequency by which hotkeys are shipped to destination clusters.

          further details. Even though this setting can technically be changed through a rolling
          restart of the cluster, in practice, not having all nodes with the same value will cause
          some of the traffic to fail as clients will either provide authentication details
          or not, therefore expecting all nodes in a cluster to either expect such authentication
          parameters or not.
