One visible difference between the Community and Enterprise Editions of the AMC is the Alerts panel. 


<table border="0">
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="/docs/amc/assets/images/1.png" alt="1" width="24" style="max-width: none">
		</td>
		<td>
			The alerts panel will display all alerts as they are triggered. Note that these are not stored in a persistent store, so reloading the Web page will result in a clearing of alerts.

	</tr>
