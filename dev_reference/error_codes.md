title: Error Codes
---

This page describes the error codes that can be returned from both client and server.

In general, error codes > 0 are server generated errors and error codes < 0 are client generated errors. There are some exceptions like AEROSPIKE_ERR_TIMEOUT (9) which is generated by both client and server.

## Client Errors

Here are the error code tables for some of the main client libraries:

- [Java Client Error Code](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/java/com/aerospike/client/ResultCode.html).

- [C# Client Error Code](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/csharp/html/AllMembers_T_Aerospike_Client_ResultCode.htm).

- [C Client Error Code](https://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/c/dc/d42/as__status_8h.html).

## Server Errors

The server error codes range from 1 to 255.

The server error codes are roughly categorized as:
- 1-49 - basic server errors
- 50-99 - security specific errors
- 100-109 - UDF specific errors
- 150-159 - batch specific errors
- 160-169 - GEO specific errors
- 200-219 - secondary index specific errors

The server log typically provides additional detail on the error at hand. 

| Value | Define | Notes | New in Version |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 0  | AS_OK | No error. |   |
| 1  | AS_ERR_UNKNOWN | Unknown server error. |  |
| 2  | AS_ERR_NOT_FOUND | No record is found with the specified namespace/set/key combination. Check the correct namesapce/set/key is passed in. |  |
| 3  | AS_ERR_GENERATION | Attempt to modify a record with unexpected generation. This happens on a read-modify-write situation where concurrent write requests collide and only one wins. |  |
| 4  | AS_ERR_PARAMETER | Illegal parameter sent from client. Check client parameters and verify each is supported by current server version. |  |
| 5  | AS_ERR_RECORD_EXISTS | For write requests which specify 'CREATE_ONLY', request fail because record already exists. | |
| 6  | AS_ERR_BIN_EXISTS | (future) For future write requests which specify 'BIN_CREATE_ONLY', request fail because any of the bin already exists. | |
| 7  | AS_ERR_CLUSTER_KEY_MISMATCH | On scan requests, the scan terminates because cluster is in migration. Only occur when client requested 'fail_on_cluster_change' policy on scan. |  |
| 8  | AS_ERR_OUT_OF_SPACE | Occurs when stop_writes is true (either memory - stop-writes-pct - or disk - min-avail-pct). Can also occur if memory cannot be allocated anymore (but stop_writes should in general hit first). Namespace will no longer be able to accept write requests. |  |
| 9  | AS_ERR_TIMEOUT | Request was not completed during the allocated time, thus aborted. |  |
| 10 | AS_ERR_ALWAYS_FORBIDDEN | Write request is rejected because XDR configuration does not allow it.  Only occurs when namespace configuration items allow-xdr-writes or allow-nonxdr-writes are false. | EE |
| 11 | AS_ERR_UNAVAILABLE | Partition unavailable (Strong Consistency mode). Will also be returned in AP mode when a transaction is received on an orphan node (a node that separated from a cluster) or, for versions prior to 4.5.2, during the initial balance for a very short time after a node joins a cluster. |  | 
| 12 | AS_ERR_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE | Operation is not allowed due to data type or namespace configuration incompatibility. For example, append to a float data type, or insert a non-integer when namespace is configured as data-in-index. |  |
| 13 | AS_ERR_RECORD_TOO_BIG | Attempt to write a record whose size is bigger than the configured write-block-size. For server versions prior to 4.5.3.4, batch read transactions containing records with size > 10MB will fail with RECORD_TOO_BIG error. See [known limits](/docs/guide/limitations.html) |  |
| 14 | AS_ERR_KEY_BUSY | Too many concurrent operations (> transaction-pending-limit) on the same record. |  |
| 15 | AS_ERR_SCAN_ABORT | Scan aborted by user on Server. |  |
| 16 | AS_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE | This feature currently is not supported. |  |
| 17 | AS_ERR_BIN_NOT_FOUND | (future) For future write requests which specify 'REPLACE_ONLY', request fail because specified bin name does not exist in record. |  |
| 18 | AS_ERR_DEVICE_OVERLOAD | Write request is rejected because storage device is not keeping up. |  |
| 19 | AS_ERR_KEY_MISMATCH | For update request on records which has key stored, the incoming key does not match the existing stored key. This indicates a RIPEMD160 key collision, and has never happened. |  |
| 20 | AS_ERR_NAMESPACE | The passed in namespace does not exist on cluster, or no namespace parameter is passed in on request. |  |
| 21 | AS_ERR_BIN_NAME | Bin name length greater than 14 characters, or maximum number of unique bin names are exceeded. | |
| 22 | AS_ERR_FORBIDDEN | Operation not allowed at this time. <ul style="font-size:12px"> <li>For writes, the set or namespace is in the middle of being deleted/truncated. <li>For writes, [stop_writes](/docs/reference/metrics#stop_writes) is reached. <li>For writes, [allow-nonxdr-writes](/docs/reference/configuration#allow-nonxdr-writes) or [allow-xdr-writes](/docs/reference/configuration#allow-xdr-writes) is prohibiting writes; <li>For scan, too many concurrent scan jobs (> scan-max-active); <li>For XDR-ed cluster, fail writes which are not replicated from another datacenter. <li>For [strong-consistency](/docs/reference/configuration/#strong-consistency) enabled namespaces, if non-durable deletes are issued against while [strong-consistency-allow-expunge](/docs/reference/configuration/#strong-consistency-allow-expunge) is set to `false` (default). <li>For [strong-consistency](/docs/reference/configuration/#strong-consistency) enabled namespaces, if [clock_skew_stop_writes](/docs/reference/metrics#clock_skew_stop_writes) is in effect, when [cluster_clock_skew_ms](/docs/reference/metrics/#cluster_clock_skew_ms) is above the [cluster_clock_skew_stop_writes_sec](/docs/reference/metrics/#cluster_clock_skew_stop_writes_sec) threshold. <li>As of Aerospike Server 4.5.1, for each [Available mode](/docs/architecture/consistency.html#available-mode) (AP) namespace where nsup is enabled (i.e. [`nsup-period`](/docs/reference/configuration/index.html#nsup-period) not zero) writes will be suspended if cluster clock skew exceeds 40 seconds.</ul>| |
