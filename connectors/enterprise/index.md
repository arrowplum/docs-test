## Overview

With Aerospike Connect, it is possible to leverage real-time data stored in Aerospike using big data frameworks that are already heavily used in the enterprise. Using the up-to-date real-time data from Aerospike, analysis and ETL applications using popular frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Kafka can vastly improve the quality and timeliness of their results in machine learning based applications. 

## Aerospike Connect for Spark

[**Aerospike Connect for Spark**](/docs/connectors/enterprise/spark/index.html) enables companies to directly integrate the Aerospike Database with their existing Spark infrastructure. In addition, Aerospike Connect for Spark allows companies to combine transactional and historical data stored in the Aerospike Database with streaming event data for consumption by machine learning and artificial intelligence engines using Apache Spark.

## Aerospike Connect for Kafka

[**Aerospike Connect for Kafka**](/docs/connectors/enterprise/kafka/index.html) makes it easy for enterprises to exchange data bi-directionally between the Aerospike Database and enterprise transactional systems at the edge and core. It can be deployed in three modes: inbound only, for ingesting data from Kafka into Aerospike; bidirectional, for ingesting data into and out of Aerospike; and developer-enabled outbound, to extract data from Aerospike into custom end points not yet supported.


## Aerospike Connect for JMS

[**Aerospike Connect for JMS**](/docs/connectors/enterprise/jms/index.html) makes it easy for enterprises to exchange data bi-directionally between the Aerospike Database and enterprise transactional systems using a JMS (Java Message Service) provider like IBM MQ, Solace, ActiveMQ Artemis and RabbitMQ.
