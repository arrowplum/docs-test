This tutorial shows how to install Aerospike Connect for Spark and walks through a few examples of reading and writing data between Spark and an Aerospike database. It also illustrates using the aeroJoin and aeroIntersect functions which allow you to load data from an Aerospike database by using a Dataset which contains keys to the records.

The tutorial is broken down into the following sections:

#### [Part 1: Read and Write DataFrames](/docs/connectors/enterprise/spark/tutorial_1.html)
Basic reading and writing data between Spark and an Aerospike database cluster.

#### [Part 2: Join, Intersect and Increment Operations](/docs/connectors/enterprise/spark/tutorial_2.html)
Leverage Aerospike's batch read functionality to perform join/intersect operations between a Spark Dataset and an Aerospike database cluster.

#### [Part 3: Spark SQL and Aerospike Connect for Spark](/docs/connectors/enterprise/spark/tutorial_3.html)
Take advantage of Spark SQL to query data from an Aerospike database cluster.

#### [Part 4: Performance Tuning](/docs/connectors/enterprise/spark/tutorial_4.html)
Ways to tune your Aerospike Connect for Spark setup in order to achieve the best performance.
