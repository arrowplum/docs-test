title: Spring Integration with Aerospike
description: Aerospike connectors for Spring Data and Spring Session
---

The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) is a Java platrom that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

Aerospike maintains two projects which allow Spring developers to easily integrate Aerospike into their Spring applications:

- The [Spring Data for Aerospike](/docs/connectors/community/spring/spring_data/index.html) connector provides a data integration layer for Aerospike that is familiar to Spring developers.
- The [Spring Session Aerospike](/docs/connectors/community/spring/spring_session/index.html) connector is built on top of Spring Data for Aerospike to provide Spring session management backed by an Aerospike database.
