title: Zabbix Integrations Guide
---

The Aerospike Zabbix plugin is available on [Github](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-zabbix).

aerospike\_discovery.py simplifies Zabbix configurations for Aerospike clusters.
The goal is to reduce the complexity to 3 simple steps.

1. Drop aerospike\_discovery.py and ssl directory into the external scripts directory of Zabbix.
2. Import the configuration template into Zabbix.
3. Add the new Aerospike Serivce Template to Aerospike Hosts in Zabbix.

### Features

- Can monitor any stat returned by
  - `$ asinfo -v 'statistics' [-h <HOST>]`
  - `$ asinfo -v 'namespace/<NAMESPACE NAME>' [-h host]`
  - `$ asinfo -v 'dc/<DATACENTER NAME>' [-h host]`

### Requirements
Additional python modules are required and installed using pip:
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing Zabbix

Many popular distributions have Zabbix packages provided. You can follow along with their [official install documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.4/manual/installation/install_from_packages) or use a third party guide like the one [written by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-zabbix-on-ubuntu-configure-it-to-monitor-multiple-vps-servers).

### Getting Started

1. Enable [external scripts](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.4/manual/config/items/itemtypes/external) for Zabbix Server. You may have already done this for other Zabbix plugins 
2. Copy aerospike\_discovery.py to the extenal scripts directory and ensure it is executable.
3. Copy ssl folder to same external scripts directory.
4. Restart/Reload Zabbix.
5. In Configuration -> Templates section of Zabbix, click `Import` and choose aerospike\_templates.xml.
6. Add the newly imported `Template App Aerospike Service` to your Aerospike Hosts.

### Namespace Checks

The default template contains namespace checks for the namespace `test`. To change
this to another namespace, go to Configuration -> Templates, and click on the Discovery section of
Template App Aerospike Service. Click on Aerospike Test Namespace Metric, and change `test` to the name of your namespace. For example, if your namespace was `fizzbuzz`:

```
    aerospike_discovery[-h,{HOST.IP},-n,fizzbuzz]
```

### Aerospike Zabbix Plugin

See *aerospike\_discovery.py*, this is the executable that Zabbix will schedule to perform
queries against Aerospike. Other than copying it to the appropriate location,
you are not required to interact with it.

### Alert Triggers

The main alert trigger is free memory/disk and if the namespace is in stop_writes. The free memory/disk
trigger is set as a template macro `{$ASD_FREE_PCT_LIMIT}`.

To add more alerts via the LLD discovery mechanism, you will need to define a new Item prototype. This
item protoytype will need to duplicate the existing discovery key, with the added exception of a unique
dummy variable. This is used since the same key cannot be used for multiple item prototype. You will also
need to add a macro filter to this item prototype to filter down the results to your interested metrics.

Next you will need to create a new trigger prototype using the item prototype that was just created.

You can still define individual alert triggers outside of the LLD mechanism.

    --tls-ciphers TLS_CIPHERS
                            Ciphers to include. See https://www.openssl.org/docs/m

                            TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, all. An optional + or - can be
                            appended before the protocol to indicate specific
                            inclusion or exclusion.
    --tls-cert-blacklist TLS_CERT_BLACKLIST

                            found in path specified by --tls-capath. Checks the
                            leaf certificates only
    --tls-crl-check-all     Check on all entries within the CRL chain

The `dummy` variable is just there so Alert Triggers can be set in batches based on item prototypes. 
However the item prototype needs to have unique keys (read: unique external script calls) so the
dummy variable is there to satisfy this uniqueness.

### Examples
To monitor all general statistics:  
```
aerospike_discovery.py -h YOUR_ASD_HOST
```

To monitor all statistics in a namespace:  
```
aerospike_discovery.py -h YOUR_ASD_HOST -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
```

To monitor a specific general statistic:  
```
aerospike_discovery.py -h YOUR_ASD_HOST -s SERVICE_NAME
```

To monitor a specific statistic in a namespace:  
```
aerospike_discovery.py -h YOUR_ASD_HOST -s SERVICE_NAME -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
```

To monitor all XDR statistics for a datacenter:
```
aerospike_discovery.py -h YOUR_ASD_HOST -x DATACENTER
```
