title : Adding a new node to an Aerospike cluster
---

Adding a node to an Aerospike cluster is an easy way to add capacity. Aerospike supports adding a single or multiple nodes to a running cluster and does not have specific requirements in the number of nodes that can be added based on the number of existing node. Cluster configured with Rackware would typically add the same number of nodes in each group.

This document provides the steps to follow to add a new node to an existing cluster.

{{#warn}}
**IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES**<br><br>
It is important to prepare the node. To avoid any scenario of pre-existing data, the drives must be initialized. New SSD drives must be prepared/installed before use. This process erases the drives using the dd command as described in the [SSD Initialization](/docs/operations/plan/ssd/ssd_init.html) section. 
<br><br>
The files under the  `/opt/aerospike/smd` folder should be removed if the node was previously in use in a different cluster. The system metadata files in this folder contain details about secondary index definitions, udf modules, user roles and permissions, truncate and truncate-namespace related information, roster information and more. Adding a node in a cluster with existing data from a different cluster in the smd folder would result in potentially disastrous situations.
{{/warn}}

## Method
If configured correctly, the new node will join the cluster automatically upon starting up the Aerospike daemon. This document is then mostly covering how to configure the new node. 

{{#info}}
The configuration file is by default under /etc/aerospike/aerospike.conf
{{/info}}

{{#warn}}
Adding a node to a cluster initiates migrations to rebalance the number of partitions across all the available nodes. Migrations occupy various system resources, so it is advised to add a node during low traffic period. This data rebalancing mechanism ensures that query volume distributes evenly across all cluster nodes, and is persistent during node failure. Please see [Auto Rebalance](/docs/architecture/data-distribution.html#automatic-rebalancing) for more information.
{{/warn}}

### Important points to consider when adding a new node to a cluster

The following must be enforced to ensure the node will properly join the cluster:
* For both in-memory and persistent namespaces, the total memory / disk space allocated for each namespace on each node should be the same (other than transient state when changing capacity).
* If the namespace is persistent the individual devices allocated to the namespace have the same capacity.
* Refer to the [Namespace Storage Configuration](/docs/operations/configure/namespace/storage) page for more information on configuring a namespace.
* [Versions prior to 3.13 only] The number of namespaces are the same on all nodes in the cluster i.e. including the new incoming node.
* [Versions prior to 3.13 only] The order of namespaces in the namespace section of the configuration file is preserved across nodes.

{{#info}}
There is no need to restart the existing nodes in the cluster to add a new node.

{{#info}}
For the purposes of performing a rolling upgrade, Aerospike supports mixed-version clusters. Aerospike does not, however, support long term use of clusters with nodes running different versions of the Aerospike database. Please see [rolling upgrade](/docs/operations/upgrade/aerospike) for more information.
{{/info}}

{{#warn}}
As a recommendation â€“ do not add multiple nodes simultaneously to avoid corner cases where the new nodes form a cluster on their own before joining the main cluster, adding more partition versions that would cause the subsequent duplicate resolution to be heavier. We recommend, as best practice, to wait for a new node to successfully join the cluster before adding the next one.
{{/warn}}

{{#warn}}
**Important when adding empty nodes:** For server version on the older paxos and heartbeat protocol (prior to 3.13), it may be prefereable to wait for migrations to complete between adding empty nodes. The older cluster protocol would drop redundant partition copies prior to completing the migration for the partition, leaving some partitions (the one that would be owned by the newly added node) with 1 less copy than dictated by the replication factor. This adds risks of data unavailability in the unlikely event of a node leaving the cluster prior to migrations completing. The more new nodes added at once, the more partitions would be losing a copy putting more data at risk in case of a node leaving the cluster.
For server versions running the new cluster protocol (3.13 and above), replica copies of a partition is kept around until the migration of the partition has completed.

The configuration file options [`node-id`](/docs/reference/configuration#node-id) and [`node-id-interface`](/docs/reference/configuration#node-id-interface) are mutually exclusive.

**Mesh mode**

* Please refer to [configure Aerospike database](/docs/operations/configure) for a detailed description of various sections of the configuration file and their relevant configuration parameters.
* The following steps assume the following:
     * A cluster(at least 1 node) is already setup in mesh mode
     * The Aerospike daemon is installed on the new node. Please see [Install Aerospike](/docs/operations/install) for the Aerospike installation procedure.
* The example used to illustrate this procedure consists of a 2 node cluster to which a 3rd node is added.

Example: 2 node cluster

**Multicast mode**
As multicast is another mode of communication for the heartbeat protocol all the other sections of the configuration files remain the same except for the heartbeat section. Please see [Network Heartbeat Configuration](/docs/operations/configure/network/heartbeat) for more information on the heartbeat section.

So, in our case the heartbeat section of the incoming node should be
```asciidoc
...
  heartbeat {
    mode multicast                  # Send heartbeats using Multicast
    multicast-group 239.1.99.2      # multicast address
    port 9918                       # multicast port
    address 10.0.0.100		     # (Optional) (Default any) IP of the NIC to
                                    # use to send out heartbeat and bind
                                    # fabric ports
    interval 150                    # Number of milliseconds between heartbeats
    timeout 10                      # Number of heartbeat intervals to wait
                                    # before timing out a node
  }
...
```

To verify the node is now a part of the cluster on any of the nodes we can issue an info commad within the asadm tool. For our example the info command outputs the following

```
We can verify the same by searching the server log at /var/log/aerospike/aerospike.log

```asciidoc
grep 'CLUSTER-SIZE' /var/log/aerospike/aerospike.log
```
You should see (from our example):
```asciidoc
