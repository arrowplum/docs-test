In addition to querying using the primary index using [key-value store](/docs/client/csharp/usage/kvs/index.html) API, the Aerospike C# client provides an API to query the database on secondary indexes.

This section discusses the following query topics:

- [Seconday indexes](/docs/client/csharp/usage/query/sindex.html)
- [Query Records](/docs/client/csharp/usage/query/query.html)
- [Aggregation](/docs/client/csharp/usage/query/aggregate.html)
- [Transforming Records](/docs/client/csharp/usage/query/query_udf.html)
