User-defined functions (UDFs) are written in the Lua programming language
running on the Aerospike database server. You use UDFs to extend Aerospike
Database engine capabilites in functionality and performance.

Refer to the following sections:

- [Register a UDF](/docs/client/rust/usage/udf/register.html)

- [Apply UDF on Record](/docs/client/rust/usage/udf/apply.html)
