description: Use the Aerospike Go client to query the database using secondary indexes.

As well as querying using the primary index using the [KVS API](/docs/client/go/usage/kvs/read.html), you can query the database using secondary indexes.

This section discusses the following topics:
- [Manage Indexes](/docs/client/go/usage/query/sindex.html)
- [Query Records](/docs/client/go/usage/query/query.html)
- [Apply UDFs on a Query](/docs/client/go/usage/query/query_udf.html)
