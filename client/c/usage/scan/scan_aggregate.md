Use the Aerospike C client to scan all records in a specified namespace or set, and aggregate the results using a Stream UDF. This is done through the Query interface by specifying no predicates on the `query` statement. 

See also [Apply Aggregate on Query](/docs/client/c/usage/query/aggregate.html).
