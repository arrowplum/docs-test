If you wish to configure multiple Aerospike cluster across two or more zones or regions, we suggest you use an Application-level Queue like [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) or [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

[Aerospike Enterprise Edition](/products-pricing) has [Cross Data Center Replication (XDR)](/docs/operations/configure/cross-datacenter) feature, which handles clusters located in multiple data centers. Please [contact us](/contact/) for further details.
